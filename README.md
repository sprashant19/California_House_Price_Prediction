# California House Price Prediction 🏡

This project focuses on predicting house prices in California based on various features such as median income, house age, and location attributes.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict median house values using machine learning techniques.
- **Dataset:** California Housing Dataset from Scikit-Learn.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
4. Model Building (Linear Regression)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Hyperparameter Tuning (if applicable)

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Achieved a good predictive performance using Linear Regression.
- Gained insights into important features influencing house prices.
- Visualized trends and patterns in the California housing market.

Insights:
Ridge regression (green) gives smoother, more stable predictions that better follow the trend and respect the cap in house values.
Lasso regression (orange) overestimates house values at higher income levels, showing signs of overfitting.
The actual data (blue) shows a non-linear relationship with a visible cap in house prices.
Ridge performs better in capturing the overall trend without extreme predictions.
